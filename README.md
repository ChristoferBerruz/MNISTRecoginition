NN for digit recognition.

NN is a simple two layer neural network object designed to classify handwritten digits.

Max accuracy is 0.89 using ReLu with 100 neurons in Hidden Layer. Current network yields 0.86 accuracy
with dropout and weight decay for 200 neurons in Hidden Layer.

For better accuracy I recommend SGD, use Mini Batch if epochs > 100.
