NN for digit recognition. This version is allows user to build any network with different number
of hidden layer and neurons in each.

Current accuracy is 0.89 using Sigmoid with 30 neurons in Hidden Layer. Network does not support weight
decay yet (working on that). 

For better accuracy I recommend STOCHASTIC, use MINIBATCH if epochs > 100.
